# ESG
This repository corresponds to a project I worked for FINE 460: Financial Analytics. 

The rising importance of climate change, gender inequality, or job dissatisfaction in public discourse puts increasing pressure on firms to adopt new corporate practices. In this context, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) scores are becoming popular metrics to reflect a company’s performance in these areas. However, these indices lack transparency, and their impact on financial performance still needs to be fully understood. Comprehensive and reliable company information is crucial to adequately incentivize investment toward sustainable projects. This research project will therefore answer the following question: what is the impact of ESG scores on the financial performance of S&P 500 firms? We will consider all three dimensions of ESG scores to assess the ESG impact on financial performance and use three different measures of financial performance: return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and Tobin’s Q (TQ).
